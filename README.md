---------------------------- Introduction ----------------------------
In the realm where shadows intertwine, a Werewolf named Yin Fang, an inner battle, a cosmic pang, in him, conflicting currents sang. A noble soul, within him lies, yet an uncontrollable tide, His other side, a feral guide, in the cosmic dance does bide. For disobedience to self, he plummeted, to the abyss profound, The lowest circle, Treachery's ground, where redemption is rarely found. Nine circles await, trials profound, each a cosmic test, Tarot cards, his only bequest, in this infernal quest. Yin Fang, in the dark abyss, must confront his inner strife, A symphony of cosmic life, through nine circles, his journey's rife. Yet within his Wolf form, salvation howls through the air, Through trials profound, a savior rare, in the cosmic tapestry's solemn glare.
