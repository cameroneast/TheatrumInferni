---------------------------- Instructions ----------------------------

You control the blue circle, and you are fighting against the two red circles. Defeat them to win, or lose. You each take turns moving. You can do 3 actions per turn, either moving or using a melee attack. Select which action to do with the buttons on the right, and then click on a highlighted square to perform the action. The black text on the characters shows how many moves it has left, and the green text shows how much health it has left.
